1Nephi|3|7|And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.
Moses|1|39|For behold, this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.
James|1|19|Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
D&C|88|35|That which abreaketh a law, and babideth not by claw, but seeketh to become a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, djustice, nor ejudgment. Therefore, they must remain ffilthy still.
